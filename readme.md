# Todos Management App

These samples implement the same app (a webapp to manage todos, incl. a relational database, a REST API) in different ways:

- [Plain Java EE](./todos-javaee)
- [Spring, Java EE integrated](./todos-spring)
- [both Java EE and Spring together](./todos-spring)
- [Spring Boot](./todos-spring-boot)

The goal is to show differences and commonalities. To avoid too much complexity for beginners,
a clean layered architecture was given up.
